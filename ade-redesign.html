            <p>In the project ADE: Redesigning Accessibility and the course Front End Development,
            I chose to create an accessible "rework" for the ADE 2022 website.

            <p>The main goal of this project was to determine whether the website was sufficiently 
            accessible for people with disabilities, and whether I could improve this.
            </p>
            
            <p>The process began with researching the website using user tests and overall findings. 
            I then made a breakdown sketch of all the sections of the website that I wanted to create, 
            because the website is quite large and I couldn't create everything in a short amount of time.
            </p>

            <div class="outro-text">
                <p>To make my website more accessible, I applied semantic HTML/CSS writing and tried to avoid 
                    as many non-semantic tags/labels as possible by working with various selector applications.
                    Accessibility testing was also done using restrictive visual aids and the VoiceOver program built in MacOS. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    More information about the entire progress in Dutch can be found on my Github repository in the readme.md.
